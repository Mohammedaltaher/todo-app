# Test Restructuring Summary

## Overview
The testing structure has been refactored to follow a component-based approach, where tests are colocated with the code they test in `__tests__` folders.

## Changes Made

1. Created component-specific test folders:
   - `src/components/__tests__/`
   - `src/context/__tests__/`
   - `src/hooks/__tests__/`
   - `src/pages/__tests__/`

2. Moved test files to their respective folders:
   - Button.test.jsx → components/__tests__/Button.test.jsx
   - Header.test.jsx → components/__tests__/Header.test.jsx
   - TodoForm.test.jsx → components/__tests__/TodoForm.test.jsx
   - TodoItem.test.jsx → components/__tests__/TodoItem.test.jsx
   - TodoList.test.jsx → components/__tests__/TodoList.test.jsx
   - TodoContext.test.jsx → context/__tests__/TodoContext.test.jsx
   - hooks.test.js → hooks/__tests__/hooks.test.js
   - HomePage.test.jsx → pages/__tests__/HomePage.test.jsx

3. Moved utility files:
   - test-utils.jsx → utils/test-utils.jsx
   - setup.js → utils/setup.js

4. Updated test imports to reflect the new file locations

5. Updated documentation:
   - Updated TESTING.md with the new test structure
   - Updated src/test/README.md with references to the new locations

## Test Issues to Fix

The tests are now properly structured, but several are failing due to implementation differences:

1. **Hook Tests**:
   - useSavingIndicator tests need updating (returned object structure has changed)

2. **Context Tests**:
   - TodoContext implementation differences (isLoading state, todo structure)
   - updateTodo function might be missing or renamed

3. **Component Tests**:
   - Button variant classes don't match expectations
   - Header component markup has changed
   - TodoForm now uses buttons instead of a dropdown for priority selection
   - TodoList empty state text and search input have changed

## Next Steps

1. Review component implementations and update the tests to match
2. Fix assertions that are failing due to different component implementations
3. Consider adding more detailed tests for new features

These changes have been made to improve the maintainability of the codebase by keeping tests closer to the code they test. This approach makes it easier to update tests when components change, and makes it clearer which components have tests.
