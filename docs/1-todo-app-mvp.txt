# Todo List Application - Phase 1: MVP

## Core Features for MVP
1. Add new tasks with title and due date
2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
3. Delete tasks
4. List view of all tasks
5. Local storage for data persistence

## Tech Stack for MVP
1. React (using Vite for fast setup)
2. State management: React Context API
3. UI: Basic shadcn/ui components
4. Styling: Tailwind CSS (included with shadcn/ui)
5. Local storage for data persistence

## shadcn/ui Components for MVP
1. Button - For actions like add, delete
2. Checkbox - For marking tasks complete/incomplete
3. Card - For task items
4. Dialog - For adding new tasks
5. Form components - For task input

## Project Structure for MVP
```
src/
  components/
    TodoForm.jsx       # Form for adding new tasks
    TodoList.jsx       # Container for all task items
    TodoItem.jsx       # Individual task component
    Header.jsx         # App header with title
  context/
    TodoContext.jsx    # State management for tasks
  utils/
    localStorage.js    # Functions to save/load from localStorage
  App.jsx              # Main app component
  main.jsx             # Entry point
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Vite project with React
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest todo-app -- --template react
   cd todo-app
   npm install
   ```

2. Install and set up shadcn/ui
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   npm install @radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-dialog
   ```

3. Create TodoContext for state management
4. Implement basic UI components
5. Add localStorage functionality for persistence
6. Test core functionality

## Estimated Timeline
- Setup and boilerplate: 1 day
- Core components implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing and bug fixes: 1 day
- Total: 4-5 days for MVP

## Success Criteria
- Users can create, complete, and delete tasks
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Basic but clean UI using shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
